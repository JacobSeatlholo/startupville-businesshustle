# Ionic Angular Example

This directory is a brief example of an [Ionic Angular](https://ionicframework.com/docs/angular/overview) app that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Ionic Angular deployed with Vercel, you can use the [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx @ionic/cli start [project-name] conference --type angular && cd [project-name]
```
